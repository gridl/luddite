The anti-browser ~ will probably come to nothing. 

A Thought Experiment in Code
----------------------------

I wonder how useful would be a browser that focussed on content rather than
shiny distractions. A browser with no JavaScript and support for only a
minimalist subset of CSS but with support for modern content related HTML such
as HTML5 media tags.

Question: what would a minimalist CSS subset include? A positive outcome with
such a limitation would be front-end development becomes a lot simpler.

Perhaps users have easy-to-configure CSS overrides ~ so content displayed
according to their preferences rather than the content provider's.

This project has been ironically checked into GitHub as a prompt for a personal
brain-break project.

Let's see how far I can get with simple Python and some media libraries... ;-)

Using TK.
